## My Contribution
For this project, I joined as a **freelancer**, assisting the game's programming team.

Initially, I was appointed to *study the project* and *create the documentation*. We tought it would be a good way to get acquaintance with the project code.
Afterwards, I took responsibility for the *championship game flow*. In this role, I received the art brief, and my task was to 
implement it in Unity and develop the championship game flow.

Another task that I had to perform was assisting the other developers in a several *bug fixes* in different parts of the game.

Overall, it was a highly satisfying experience because the team was exceptionally talented and pleasant to work with.
