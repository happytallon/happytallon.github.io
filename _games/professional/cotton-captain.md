The game **As Aventuras do Capitão Algodão** (The Adventures of Cotton Captain), produced by [**Crenix Games**][crenix], narrates the journey of the chosen child and its mentor, the bunny *Algodão*, on a quest to restore balance to the city of *Outrolândia*. To complete this quest, they must cooperate with the city's inhabitants and solve *puzzles* to help them overcome their emotional, physical, and environmental challenges. Finally, they must face a terrible monster that thrives on these issues.

The game is remarkably captivating and presents a compelling narrative about friendship, courage, and the power of emotions.

## My Contribution
In this game, I worked as the **main programmer** on the team, receiving guidance from the leads on the structure of the project.
As the project evolved, the team expanded by bringing two additional programmers to help with the remaining puzzles.  
It was an incredibly rewarding experience, not only because of the fantastic team but also for the theme itself, that I personally think are very important.
