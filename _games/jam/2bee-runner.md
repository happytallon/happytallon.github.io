<!-- This is commented out. -->

**2BRunner** was a game created for the [**GameDev.tv**][gamedevtv] jam (**2023**).
It features a mechanic similar to *Flappy Bird*, introducing an *inverted world* that the player must navigate simultaneously.

***

## My Contribution
In this game, I worked almost entirely on my own, focusing on programming and implementation in Unity.
I only had help from a friend to find art and audio assets on the internet.

## Key Features
- Similar mechanics to *Flappy Bird* with an *inverted world*
- Scoring based on distance and collectible points :)
- A beautiful tutorial by Erica Nascimento
