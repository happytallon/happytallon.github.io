**Back in the Loop** is a classic [**shmup**] that tells the story of a *bounty hunter spaceship*.

The gameplay is one-shot, featuring a several enemy types and four challenging bosses.
The game offers 3 types of shots that are upgraded in parallel, depending on the player's choice, and a powerful shot that is unlocked after the player maximizes all other shots.

## My Contribution
This project was my first polished game.
Its core was developed during a course, and after course's conclusion, I expanded the project by adding more content.

While the project wasn't overwhelmingly complex, it demanded a considerable investment of time. Here are some of the mechanics I added:
- **Power-ups:** I created 4 power-ups, each with its own independent level-up path. One of them is only unlocked when the other three are maximized.
- **More Enemies:** I introduced enemies with distinct *AIs*. These AIs determine their movement and attack patterns. To add depth, I designed 4 unique bosses with slightly more complex AIs.
- **Additional dynamic elements:** increased gravity (slowing down the player), vortexes that release an energy burst when destroyed, and more.
