**Brick Breaker** is a clone of the classic *brick breaker* game.
The game features *5 levels* and an internal *pixel art reader* to help the developer to create more levels.

***

## My Contribution
This game was a result of a game development course I was taking.
It was one of my first experiences with Unity, and it was quite rewarding, which is why I decided to include it in my portfolio.

My biggest challenge was to *create a system* that could read a pixel art image (20p x 20p) and dynamically create the level blocks *according to the image*. This way, I could create more levels more easily.

Initially the project was a bit different. I had designed it much larger, with 25 levels, and each level had a unique map. Later, I felt that the game was getting a bit monotonous, so I reduced it to just 5 levels, along with other architectural refactors.
