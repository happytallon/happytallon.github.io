## Hello World!

I'm **Caue Marcovich**, a *game programmer* from SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. I've been working as a game developer since 2021 and as Web Developer since 2013, but my journey with games began long before that.

My love for games started in my early years when I used to visit my cousins' place to play some classics from **DOS** games.  
Eventually, my father gifted me my first gaming console: a **Super Nintendo**. The memory of my first time playing **Super Mario World** is still vivid in my mind and is likely to remain with me forever.  
*Fun fact: I used to be scared of Bowser, and my father had to beat him for me. Thank you dad!*

Ever since, I've explored games from a variety of platforms and cultivated a deep-seated love for gaming in general.

Nowadays, nearly all the areas of game development brings my interest, but most of them are more like hobbies. My professional focus, however, remains centered around game programming.

## My Career:
I've always dreamt of working in the gaming industry, although that wasn't where it all began...

#### As Web Developer
My career as a developer began in 2013 at [**Level Up! Games**][levelup] as a **.NET Developer**, working on features for the company's websites. In 2015, I was selected to join a team responsible for starting the development of a game distribution platform in Brazil, known today as [**Hype**][hype].

In 2016, I left **Level Up!** and started to think about my career. That's when I decided to create my first game using ***RPG Maker*** with a friend. Thanks to this game I realized that this was what I wanted to do, but I also understood that it wouldn't be easy as I thought. Therefore, I decided to find a .NET job and gradually study game development.

In 2018, I got a position as a **Web Developer** at [**MadeinWeb**][madeinweb], which was one of my best experiences. Thanks to some amazing people, I had the opportunity to grow in different skills, both technical and soft. Meanwhile, I began my degree in *Digital Games at Cruzeiro do Sul* university and started working on some personal projects on my free time.

#### As Game Developer
My first opportunity in the gaming industry came in mid-2021.  
[**Crenix Games**][crenix] was looking for game developers to work in some educational games, and I was hired as a *freelancer* to work on one of them: [**The Adventures of Captain Cotton**][aventurasalgodao].  
I decided to accept the challenge, and I was the only programmer on the team for a significant part of the project, only receiving guidance from the leads on the structure of the project.  
After a while, working  two jobs eventually became quite exhausting as both demanded a substantial amount of my time and that's why I made the decision to leave **MadeinWeb** and fully immerse myself in the gaming market. ***This was my leap of faith!***  
The whole experience was very challenging and I worked with amazing people, resulting in a great job. So well that after the end of the project the game won the *Best Children's Game* award at the [**Big Festival**][bigfestival].

Later on, I had to seek new opportunities in the gaming industry. Fortunately, two more excellent companies came my way: [**Lunic Games**][lunic] and [**VRGlass**][vrglass].

At [**Lunic Games**][lunic], I contributed as an *assistant programmer* on the [**Star Strikers: Galactic Soccer**][starstrikers]. Initially, I began by getting acquaintance studying the project code and doing the documentation, and afterwards, assisting in the code.

At [**VRGlass**][vrglass], I worked on [**Virtual Town**][virtualtown], a metaverse environment that pushed me out of my comfort zone and gave me the opportunity to work with a lot of new technologies that I hadn't previously used.

For more in-depth insights into the projects, you can explore my [portfolio]."

#### What is yet to come (^_^)

I aspire to be a great game developer in the future, mainly looking at various aspects of the game production. And I'm always looking for a projects that can bring me to it.

If you have any interest on my work, please, don't hesitate to contact me.
I'm looking forward to hear from you! :)
